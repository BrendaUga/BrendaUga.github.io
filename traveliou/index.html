        <p class="project-description">
            This project addresses the pain of splitting costs between parties during travels. Travellers often offer to pay for other parties to simplify the interactions with service providers in a foreign environment. Having to split dining bills at the table, dealing with language barriers and calculations is often a source of frustration for both parties involved. TravelIOU steps in to offer understanding of IOUs resulting from the scenarios described. When entering information on amounts, payers and owers, the system keeps track of who owes whom. Owed amounts are calculated to keep the amount of transactions to the minimum.

        <p class="project-description">
            As the primary users are travellers on the go, a responsive mobile interface was primary. Thus, the project was developed with a mobile-first approach, focusing on mobile interactions. The interface comprises of a dashboard-style view of amounts owed to the user and amounts owed by the user, and a history of trips and payments.
            <br><br>An iterative design process was utilized with several meetings with the stakeholders in order to collect feedback. Designs were evaluated with both an heuristic approach and walkthroughs with stakeholders. The primary flow was identified to be creating a payment, marking debtors and checking off paid debts. In the process, miscommunication resulted in the product not fulfilling the users' needs, but this was remedied by creating a detailed list of requirements together with the stakeholders. Ticking off requirements resulted in a product that does what is needed and facilitates marking down IOUs during travels.
