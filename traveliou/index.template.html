            TravelIOU is a mobile travel expenses splitting system to make payments and IOUs manageable in groups. Entering payment information results in calculated amounts owed by all parties.
            <br><br> A NodeJS back-end with jQuery front-end. I designed the app and coded it in tandem with a developer. Currently undergoing a redesign according to the process described below.

        <h2 class="project-subheading"><span>02.</span> Mission</h2>
        <p class="project-description">
            This project addresses the pain of splitting costs between parties during travels. Travellers often offer to pay for other parties to simplify the interactions with service providers in a foreign environment. Having to split dining bills at the table, dealing with language barriers and calculations is often a source of frustration for both parties involved.
            <br><br>
            TravelIOU steps in to offer understanding of IOUs resulting from the scenarios described. When entering information on amounts, payers and owers, the system keeps track of who owes whom. Owed amounts are calculated to keep the amount of transactions to the minimum.

        <p class="project-description">
            In this process, I started by sketching a preliminary idea of the app on paper. This paper prototype was then presented in a meeting with the stakeholders, and the main flows were played through. This resulted in first feedback and a lot of changes for us. For example, the stakeholders pointed out that it was unclear how to navigate to 'My payments', and that the app would benefit from adding a top-level bottom navigation bar. In addition, we together deemed it more intuitive to use natural language sentences in the UI, instead of just listing names and amounts. This was brought up to combat the unclear meanings behind the names (whether the person owes me or I owe them) and numbers.

            As the primary users are travellers on the go, a responsive mobile interface was primary. Thus, the project was developed with a mobile-first approach, focusing on mobile interactions. The interface comprises of a dashboard-style view of amounts owed to the user and amounts owed by the user, and a history of trips and payments. The user is able to quickly mark down payments and keep an eye on the amounts owed by all parties.
            <br><br>An iterative design process was utilized with several meetings with the stakeholders in order to collect feedback. Prototypes were evaluated with both an heuristic approach and using the co-discovery method in walkthroughs.

        <h2 class="project-subheading"><span>04.</span> Results</h2>
        <p class="project-description">
            For the final product, the above flows and interactions are currently being implemented. As this app is mainly used during travels and on mobile devices, a lot of effort went into designing it to be simple and usable, so the process of marking down payments is possible in difficult scenarios.
