            UI and UX design for a Moodle learning management system used at Tallinn University of Technology. A complete UI rehaul based on user research and feedback, as well as coding the designs myself.
            <br><br>
            Ained.ttu.ee is a Moodle based LMS that is used in courses offered at the School of IT in TUT. The system provides many functions, the most used being publishing course materials, submitting homework and grading homework submissions. The underlying LMS system utilizes a theme-based interface customization, that offers no separation of concerns, meaning that UI and back-end logic are clustered together.

            This project started out as an effort to customize a Moodle theme to reflect the university's brand. During the process, several drawbacks were identified in the theme that would affect the user experience. As this system is used daily in most School of IT courses in TUT, it was clear that bigger changes were in order to relieve users' frustration. A heuristic evaluation was carried out on the previous theme, identifying problems and ranking them based on severity. This resulted in fixing the most obvious problems, such as prioritizing the most-needed functions and removing clutter from the single-course pages.

            Users were involved during the next iteration of the UI development. User feedback was gathered with in-person interviews with both teachers and students, and during day-to-day informal communication. Furthermore, a survey was sent out to gauge the general populations' feelings toward the system and to further identify problem areas. The survey results showed that, in general, the system was deemed usable and convenient by the users. Still, users' felt that page copy was lacking in clear hierarchy, functions were hidden behind menus and the mobile interface was not well discoverable. Solutions were generated and evaluated in collaboration with the designers, developers and the department's stakeholders.
            <br><br>In the end, a suitable interface was created, that aimed to provide simplicity and efficiency to both the teachers and students using the system daily. Since then, development has continued with new designers and developers.
